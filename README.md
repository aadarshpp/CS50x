# CS50x 2025

This repository documents my personal journey through [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard University's world-renowned Introduction to Computer Science. The course covers foundational topics such as algorithms, memory, data structures, and web development, using languages including C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript. 

I am taking this course to deepen my understanding of core computer science principles and to apply them through hands-on problem sets and projects.
