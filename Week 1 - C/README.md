# Week 1: C – Hello, Mario, Cash, and Credit

This session introduced the fundamentals of the C programming language, covering concepts like loops, conditions, functions, and user input.

## Problem Set

### [Hello](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/1/me/)
A simple program that greets the user.

- **Objective:** Prompt the user for their name and print `hello, name`.

### [Mario (Less Comfortable)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/1/mario/less)
Prints a right-aligned half-pyramid of hashes (`#`), inspired by Super Mario Bros.

- **Objective:** Prompt for a height and print a half-pyramid with 1 to 8 rows. Ask again if the input is out of range.

### [Mario (More Comfortable)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/1/mario/more)
Prints a full pyramid with two sides and a gap in the middle.

- **Objective:** Prompt for a height and build a double-sided pyramid pattern. Ask again if the input is out of range.

### [Cash](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/1/cash)
Implements a greedy algorithm to determine the minimum number of coins required for change.

- **Objective:** Given a dollar amount, calculate the least number of coins needed.

### [Credit](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/1/mario/credit)
Validates a credit card number using Luhn’s Algorithm and identifies its type.

- **Objective:** Check if a card number is valid and determine if it's AMEX, MASTERCARD, or VISA.
