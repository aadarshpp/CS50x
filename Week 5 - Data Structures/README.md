# Week 5: Data Structures

This week focused on data structures like linked lists, hash tables, and tries. We learned how different structures can improve efficiency in storing and retrieving data. We also explored tree-based structures and how they relate to real-world modeling like family trees through class inheritance.

## Problem Set

### [Inheritance](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/5/inheritance/)
Simulates genetic inheritance using a recursive data structure.

- **Objective:**  
  Model a family tree where each person inherits two alleles from their parents. Practice using structs and recursion to build and traverse the tree.

### [Speller](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/5/speller/)
Implements a spell checker that reads through a text file and identifies words not found in a dictionary.

- **Objective:**  
  Write a program that uses a hash table to load a dictionary into memory and check the spelling of words from a given text.
