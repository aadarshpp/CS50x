# Sort

This task involved analyzing three compiled sorting programs to determine which sorting algorithm—Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, or Merge Sort—was implemented in each.

## What I Did

I examined the behavior of each program by observing how elements were compared, swapped, or divided during the sorting process. I looked for patterns characteristic of each algorithm:

- Selection Sort: repeatedly selecting the smallest element and placing it in order
- Bubble Sort: swapping adjacent elements until the list is sorted
- Merge Sort: recursively dividing the list and merging sorted halves
