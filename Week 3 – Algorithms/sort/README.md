# Sort

This task is part of the CS50x problem sets, where I worked on understanding and implementing sorting algorithms. I was given the executables `sort1`, `sort2`, `sort3`, and tasked with analyzing them to determine which sorting algorithm each one implemented. In addition to this analysis, I also implemented my own versions of Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Merge Sort in C.

## What I Did

Through the CS50x problems, I analyzed and worked with the given sorting executables (`sort1`, `sort2`, `sort3`) to understand how elements were compared, swapped, or divided during the sorting process. I then wrote my own C implementations for the following sorting algorithms:

- **Selection Sort:** Repeatedly selecting the smallest element and placing it in order.
- **Bubble Sort:** Swapping adjacent elements until the list is sorted.
- **Merge Sort:** Recursively dividing the list and merging sorted halves.

Apart from analyzing the given `sort1`, `sort2`, and `sort3` executables, I also implemented these algorithms on my own to further deepen my understanding of sorting techniques. The analysis of the behaviors observed in the compiled programs is recorded in `answer.txt`.
