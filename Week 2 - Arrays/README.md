# Week 2: Arrays

This session focused on how compilers work, arrays, strings, cryptography, and how to manipulate data at a low level.

## Problem Set

### Scrabble
Determines the winner of a short Scrabble-like game by comparing the scores of two players' words.

### Readability
Calculates the readability of a text using the Coleman-Liau index, which estimates the U.S. school grade level required to understand a text.

- **Objective:** Write a program that takes in a string and computes its readability score, outputting the corresponding grade level.

### Caesar
Implements a Caesar cipher, a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions.

- **Objective:** Prompt for a key and encrypt a string using the Caesar cipher.

### Substitution
Implements a substitution cipher, a more advanced encryption method where each letter in the alphabet is substituted with a different letter.

- **Objective:** Prompt for a key, validate that it’s a valid substitution cipher, and encrypt a string.
